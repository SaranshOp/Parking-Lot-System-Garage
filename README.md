## üìñ Overview

The **Parking Lot Management System** is a feature-rich web application designed to manage parking lots efficiently. Built using **TypeScript** and **NextJs**, this project is my third iteration in a series of parking management systems evolving from my previous implementations in **Python** and **FastAPI**. This project introduces **role-based access control, dynamic UI updates, multi-lot management, vehicle history tracking, and advanced querying**‚Äîall built on top of the original assignment requirements.

This project builds upon the foundational concepts of **Project 1&2**, which focused on object-oriented programming principles and iterative experimentation. This is my **third iteration**, following a structured learning approach:

1. **First Iteration** - Focused on understanding functional requirements and implemented as a **CLI-based system**.
2. **Second Iteration** - Built with **FastAPI and JavaScript** for a basic web-based version.
3. **Final Iteration** - Fully transitioned to **Next.js + TypeScript** with an intuitive UI and enhanced feature set.

## üöÄ Key Features

### üé≠ Role-Based Access Control

The system now supports three distinct roles with **varying levels of control**:

- **Admin**:

  - Create and manage multiple parking lots.
  - View and analyze the **history of incoming and outgoing vehicles**.
  - Drag and modify parking lots dynamically.
  - Access all operator functionalities.

- **Operator**:

  - Park vehicles dynamically based on type (Bike, Car, Truck).
  - Process payments and handle vehicle exits.

- **User**:

  - Query available spots **per parking lot and per vehicle type**.
  - Lookup vehicle locations using registration numbers.

---

### üè¢ Multi-Lot Parking Management

- **Admins can create multiple parking lots**, each with its own floors and spot distribution.
- **Lots can be dragged and reorganized dynamically**.
- **Users can query lots based on location and availability**.

---

### üöò Vehicle Operations & Tracking

1. **Real-time Vehicle Parking**:

   - Vehicles are assigned to the **nearest available spot**.
   - Operators can easily park and exit vehicles via an interactive UI.

2. **History & Audit Logs**:

   - **Admins can track all vehicle movements**, including entry/exit timestamps.
   - Payment and duration records are maintained per vehicle.

3. **Advanced Querying**:

   - Users can filter by **lot, vehicle type, and availability**.
   - Vehicles can be located using **registration numbers**.

---

### üìä Real-Time Tracking & Availability

- **Admins and users can check live floor-wise availability**.
- **Operators receive real-time updates on parking space utilization**.
- **Quick search functionality** allows users to locate their parked vehicles.

---

## üóí Assignment Requirements Fulfilled

‚úÖ **Multiple floors & spots** per parking lot.
‚úÖ **Different vehicle types & space allocation** (Bike = 1, Car = 1, Truck = 2 consecutive spots).
‚úÖ **Nearest available spot assignment** for parking.
‚úÖ **Vehicle exit & payment processing**.
‚úÖ **Querying available spots, full lot status, and vehicle location**.
‚úÖ **Concurrency handling** using event loops and locks.
‚úÖ **Optimized for future scalability**.

---

### üïí Parking History

Admins can view a detailed history of all parked vehicles, including:

- Entry/exit times
- Payment records
- Vehicle registration details

---

## üíª Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend (Previous Version)**: FastAPI, Python
- **Concurrency Management**: AsyncIO (Python), Next.js API routes
- **State Management**: React Context API / Zustand
- **Database (Future Scope)**: PostgreSQL or Firebase

## ![Parking Lot Management System ](asset/final_image.png)

## üìà API Endpoints

### Admin Endpoints

- `POST /admin/create-lot`: Create a new parking lot with specified floors and spots per floor.
- `GET /history/{lot_name}`: Retrieve the complete parking history of a specific lot.

### Operator Endpoints

- `POST /operator/park`: Park a vehicle in an available spot based on its type.
- `POST /operator/payment`: Process payment for parked vehicles based on duration.
- `POST /operator/exit`: Exit a vehicle after payment is completed.

### User Endpoints

- `GET /availability/{lot_name}/{vehicle_type}`: Check floor-wise availability for a specific vehicle type in a lot.
- `GET /vehicle-lookup/{reg_num}`: Find the location of a vehicle by its registration number.
